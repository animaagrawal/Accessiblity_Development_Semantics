SCREEN READERS AND THEIR USAGE
Screen readers are software programs that allow visually impaired individuals to access and interact with digital content by converting text and other elements on a computer screen into audio or braille output.
NVDA is a popular and free screen reader for Windows. Here are a few basic usage tips:
1. Install NVDA on your Windows computer and launch it.
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the content on the screen, or use keyboard shortcuts to jump to specific elements such as headings or links. When using NVDA, the arrow keys on your keyboard allow you to navigate through the content on the screen, one element at a time. For example, pressing the down arrow key will move you from the current element to the next element below it.
	NVDA also has several keyboard shortcuts that allow you to jump directly to specific elements, such as headings or links. Here are a few examples:
		• To jump to the next heading, press the H key. To jump to the previous heading, press the Shift+H keys.
		• To jump to the next link, press the K key. To activate the link, press Enter. To go back to the previous page, press Alt+Left arrow keys.
		• To jump to the next form control (such as a text box or checkbox), press the F key. To interact with the control (i.e. fill in a text box or check a checkbox), press Enter.
	By using these navigation and shortcut keys, you can efficiently explore and interact with the content on the screen using NVDA.
3. Use the NVDA key (often the Insert key) in combination with other keys to access different functions, such as reading the current line or spelling the current word.
4. Customize NVDA settings to adjust the speech rate, voice, and other preferences to better suit your needs.
5. The Speech Viewer is a tool that comes bundled with NVDA, which allows you to view the text of what NVDA is currently speaking out loud.
	Here's how to start it:
		a. Press the NVDA key (often the Insert key) and the letter N together to open the NVDA menu.
		b. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the "Tools" submenu, and press Enter to open it.
		c. Navigate to the "Speech Viewer" option, and press Enter to start it.
	Once the Speech Viewer is running, you can view the text that NVDA is speaking by simply looking at the Speech Viewer window. This can be especially helpful if you missed something that NVDA said or if you want to review a particular passage.
	To close the Speech Viewer, press the Alt+F4 keys, or use the NVDA menu to navigate to the "Exit" option.
